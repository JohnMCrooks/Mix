Pork Tenderloin Diablo|40|Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Season pork with salt and pepper. Heat oil in an ovenproof skillet over high heat. Cook pork until browned on one side, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn over pork and transfer the skillet to the preheated oven. Cook until pork is browned and still slightly pink in the center, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Transfer pork to a plate. Remove any excess oil from the skillet and place it over medium-high heat. Pour in chicken broth and bring to a boil, scraping any browned bits off of the bottom of the pan. Whisk in cream, horseradish, Dijon mustard, and cayenne pepper. Continue cooking until the mixture is reduced to a thick sauce, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in cold butter. Stir in chives. Slice pork into 1/2-inch slices and serve topped with sauce.|1 lb whole pork tenderloin, salt + pepper, 2 teaspoons veggie oil, 1/2 cup chicken broth, 2 tablespoons heavy cream, 1Tbs hot prepared horseradish, 1 tbs dijon mustard, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 tbs cold butter, 1 tsp fresh chives|advanced|0|Dinner|http://foodnetwork.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/food/fullset/2003/10/16/4/tm1b27_pork_tenderloins3.jpg|1
Grilled Chicken with Rosemary and Bacon|26|Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon garlic powder on a chicken breast and season with salt and pepper. Lay one rosemary sprig on the chicken breast. Wrap the bacon around the chicken to hold the rosemary on. Secure the bacon with a toothpick or an additional thick rosemary stem.  Cook the chicken breasts until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Stay near the grill to combat any flare ups from the bacon. Remove the toothpicks before serving.|4tsp garlic powder, 4 skinless boneless chicken breast halves, salt + pepper, 4 sprigs fresh rosemary, 4 thick slices bacon.|Beginner|0|Dinner|http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/600x600/658775.jpg|1
